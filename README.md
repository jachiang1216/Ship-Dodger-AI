# Ship-Dodger-AI
## 1. Overview
Given obstacles to traverse through, the AI Bot attempts to navigate the player ship to make it further into the level.
The level is an autoscroll and the ship will auto move up with incoming obstacles. 
The AI is only given two available ship controls to toggle between: Left and Right

In order to decide what controls to press, the program utilizes NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) Python library.
This neural network is tweaked on its input nodes and various parameters to allow the AI progress and learn faster.

Programmed in Python 3.7.
